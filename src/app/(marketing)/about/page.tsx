                                We used to be the people sitting on the other side of this problem.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before Openrize, we worked in hospitality and retail — long hours, lean teams, and a constant flood of operational fires to put out.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Then one day, the reviews piled up. Not because the service was bad — but because there simply wasn't enough time to respond. A 1-star review sat unanswered for two weeks. Then a franchise penalty came down. Then another property's rating slipped below 4.0 on Google, and the booking numbers followed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We were sitting in a back office at 11 PM, eyes burning, copy-pasting the same response to a dozen reviews across four platforms and thinking: <em>"There has to be a better way."</em>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There wasn't. Not one that was affordable, focused, and built for real business owners. So we built Openrize.
